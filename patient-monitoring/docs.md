# Patient Monitoring System

## Problem Statement
A reputed Cardiologist runs a clinic in downtown. He realised, there was a need to have a case history of his key customers maintained. A simple system where he would track the vital signs of his customer on each visit, the results of diagnostic reports, his prognosis and prescribed medicines. Can you develop a simple lightweight system for him?
